## Design Questions
---
Build env requires a specific CWD, and action references a file path. Should the file path be relative to the build env's required CWD, or the CWD of the project directory?

---
__Project and Action Contexts:__

Should these be provided as globals, or as function parameters? (Easier to supply project context as globals compared to action context.)

Idea:

Project context is available under global var `PROJECT`, which points to the topmost entry in the "project stack" stored at `cobble.project_stack`.

The "project stack": When first asked to process a project file cobble will push an initial project context onto the stack.  When a `project_dir(...)` function call is made, the `project_dir` function will push a new project context onto the stack before processing the project file in the requested directory.  Before returning, `project_dir` pops the project context off of the stack, so that the correct project context is active while the rest of the original project is processed.

Available project variables:
- `PROJECT.name`
- `PROJECT.dir`
- `PROJECT.build_envs`
- `PROJECT.tasks`
- `PROJECT.subprojects`

Action contexts are passed in as arguments to functions.

Note on actions: if an action depends on a tool or build env, it must be visible to cobble while computing dependencies.  For this reason, an action can't simply be a function that then invokes commands in various build environments.  The build environment used must be visible outside of the function.

Declaring an action as part of a task might look like this:

```lua
task {
    -- ...,
    actions = {
        { build_env = "poetry", exec = function(self, cxt) end }
    }
}
```

Where `act` is a reference to the action object (table) that defined the action, (in this case, `{ build_env = "poetry", exec = function(act, cxt) end }`,) and `cxt` is the action context.

Action context fields:
- `cxt:tool` - A function that will execute the external tool's action
- `cxt:build_env` - A function that will execute the build environment's action
- `cxt.project_dir` - The directory of the project from which the action request originated

---
__Handling CWD:__
CWD should always be the project directory for actions unless specified.  Initial action invocation will set `cxt.project_dir`, which should propagate to subsequent calls to `cxt:exec` from within that action.

---
__WORKSPACE:__ Like `PROJECT`, there's a `WORKSPACE` global var that provides workspace-level information:
- `WORKSPACE.dir`
- `WORKSPACE.vars`

---

How to handle naming conflicts of tasks, build envs, etc. that are generated by task generators in the same project?

Have the ability to define a subproject with a prefix within a project file.  If we do this, a project will need both a (unique) name and an associated directory.
